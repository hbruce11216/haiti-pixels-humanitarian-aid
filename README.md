# haiti-pixels-humanitarian-aid
Analysis of pixels dataset from aerial photo of Haiti after the 2010 earthquake. Displaced people were living under blue tarps. Goal of this project is to use several Supervised Learning techniques to determine where the displaced people are so that humanitarian aid can be provided.

This was an incredibly interesting project. Check out the "CourseProjectPart2_holden_bruce.html" or "CourseProjectPart2_holden_bruce" files (they are identical) to dive into the work I did exploring this problem.
